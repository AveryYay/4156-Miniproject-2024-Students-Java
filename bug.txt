Department.java:
1. getDepartmentChair() originally returns "this.departmentChair", changed to return this.departmentChair
    - PMD rule violation: Unused private field `departmentChair` in `Department` class.
2. toString() originally only returns "result.toString()" as a string, while it should be result.toString().
3. getNumberOfMajors() returns -this.numberOfMajors while it should return this.numberOfMajors.
4. dropPersonFromMajor() now just decrements enrolledStudentCount regardless if the number of majors is zero.
   According to the Javadoc, it should only drop if it's greater than zero. Changed to the correct logic.

Course.java:
1. getCourseLocation() returns this.instructorName while it should return the course location as the function
   name stated. Changed to return this.courseLocation.
2. getInstructorName() returns this.courseLocation while it should return the instructor name as the function
   name stated. Changed to return this.instructorName.
3. isCourseFull() originally return true if the capacity is greater than enrolled student count, while the correct
   logic should be return true if the enrolled student count is greater than or equal to the capacity.
   Changed to return enrollmentCapacity <= enrolledStudentCount.
4. enrollStudent() originally just increments enrolledStudentCount regardless if the course is full. However,
   according to the Javadoc, it should only enroll a student if there's space available. It also returns false
   no matter what, while it should return true, if enrolled successfully, and return false otherwise.
   Changed to the correct logic.
5. dropStudent() originally just decrements enrolledStudentCount regardless if there is no student enrolled. However,
   according to the Javadoc, it should only drop a student if a student is enrolled. It also returns false
   no matter what, while it should return true, if dropped successfully, and return false otherwise.
   Changed to the correct logic.

RouteController.java
1. findCourseTime returns new ResponseEntity<>("The course meets at: " + "some time ", HttpStatus.OK) if the
   course does exist. Changed to return new ResponseEntity<>("The course meets at: " +
   requestedCourse.getCourseTimeSlot(), HttpStatus.OK).
   - PMD rule violation: Unused local variable `requestedCourse` in `RouteController` class.
2. In retrieveDepartment, it returns HttpStatus.NOT_FOUND when the department was found, and returns HttpStatus.OK
   when the department was not found. -->Swapped
3. retrieveCourse returns HttpStatus.FORBIDDEN if the course is not found, which is inappropriate. Changed to return
   HttpStatus.OK.
4. getMajorCtFromDept is returning the negative value -departmentMapping.get(deptCode) if the department is found,
   which should return departmentMapping.get(deptCode).
   It also returns HttpStatus.Forbidden when the department is not found, which is inappropriate. Changed to return
   HttpStatus.NOT_FOUND instead.

   was updated successfully."
